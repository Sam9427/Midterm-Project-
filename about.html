        <h1>Colorism In The Media</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="content">
        <p>Like most of us, consuming media has quickly become a part of our everyday lives. Whether it's Instagram, TikTok, or Netflix, the options are endless, and unfortunately, colorism runs rampant throughout these spaces.</p>
        
        <p>For instance, in the film adaptation of <em>The Hate You Give</em>, the main character Starr Carter is portrayed by a light-skinned actress, despite being described as a dark-skinned girl in the novel. This casting choice sparked criticism, as it exemplifies how dark-skinned characters are often overlooked in favor of "marketable" alternatives.</p>
        
        <p>This practice is harmful because representation of dark-skinned Black women as main characters is rare. When such a character is altered to be lighter-skinned, it contributes to the erasure of Black stories and reinforces narrow beauty standards in media.</p>
