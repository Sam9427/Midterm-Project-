        <h2>Understanding Colorism</h2>
        <p>Colorism is discrimination based on skin tone, often favoring lighter skin over darker skin within communities of color.</p>
        <p>Media representations often reinforce these biases, intentionally or otherwise. This website aims to educate and provide resources for understanding colorism and its effects in our society.</p>

        <h2>Colorism in the Media</h2>
        <p>One example of colorism in media can be seen in the casting of the film <em>The Hate You Give</em>. The novel features Starr Carter, described as a dark-skinned girl with coily hair, but in the movie, the role was given to a light-skinned actress with looser curls. This choice sparked backlash, as it highlights how dark-skinned actresses are often overlooked for “marketable” alternatives.</p>
